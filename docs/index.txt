# DicoJuice Getting Started

DiscoJuice may be deployed *embedded* or *standalone*. When DiscoJuice is deployed embedded it is associated with a login button, and will popup as soon as the user clicks the button. This setup may only be used for pages that allow presenting a web page before the user logs in. When DiscoJuice is deployed *standalone* it is a separate web page, a web page that the user is redirected to (using the IdP Discovery Service Protocol - widely available already).

DiscoJuice may be deployed at the service provider as a client, never accepting incomming requests from other service providers. Or it may be deployed *central* not representing any particular service provider, but is configured to accept requests from a wide range of service providers.

DiscoJuice is written entirely in JavaScript, which mean it will run with your Service regardless of what programming language or environment it runs in. But it also available as a module for SimpleSAMLphp for supersmooth integration.

The only part that needs to run on the server side is the metadata feed. This may very well be a static file offered by some third party (a federation operator) or may be loaded on a central location using JSONP.
