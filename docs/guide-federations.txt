DiscoJuice Guide for Federations
================================


Some topics that affects you as a federation operator:

* Offering DiscoJuice friendly metadata
* Offering a central discovery service (just storage or with UI)
* Offering customized configuration instructions for DiscoJuice in your federation



## Offering DiscoJuice friendly metadata

You probably already offer SAML 2.0 Metadata to your Federation members. This metadata probably contains technical details about the SAML entities and in addition a *Organization name*.

There is a lot more information that you can (and should) include in your metadata.

The most important reference here is the metadata extension for UI:

* [Metadata Extensions for Login and Discovery User Interface](http://wiki.oasis-open.org/security/SAML2MetadataUI)

The following information will be used by DiscoJuice:

* DisplayName
* Description
* Keywords
* Logo
* GeolocationHint

The following information is not supported yet, but will be soon:

* IPHint
* DomainHint


The following information will not be used:

* InformationURL
* PrivacyStatementURL



DiscoJuice does not support SAML 2.0 Metadata, but instead interprets it's own more compact format, [DiscoJuiceJSON](discojuicejson). Somehow DiscoJuice needs to convert SAML 2.0 metadata to DiscoJuiceJSON. This can happen one of the following ways:

1. Federation offering a central DiscoJuiceJSON feed complimenting the SAML 2.0 metadata feed. The feed may be used directly in DiscoJuice using JSONP, or it may be relayed by the Service Provider.
2. Service Provider using SimpleSAMLphp to automatically convert and offer a DiscoJuiceJSON feed. SimpleSAMLphp does not yet support MDUI parsing, but it is scheduled to be supported very soon.
3. Service Provider using Shibboleth to automatically convert and offer a DiscoJuiceJSON feed. The Shibboleth JSON feed is currently partly compatible with DiscoJuiceJSON.
4. Service Provider is using some other tool to convert or generate the feed, or the feed is created manually. 



## Offering a central discovery service (just storage or with UI)

If the Federation already has a decent DiscoJuiceJSON feed in place (see above), the next step may be to setup a central Discovery Service (or Storage) using DiscoJuice. It is off course not neccessary to operate a central Discovery Service in a Federation, but many Federations already does this, and would like to contiue doing so.

The central DiscoJuice deployment may be installed and configured the same was as if it was installed on a Service Provider. It may be installed stand-alone (only JS) or through the simpleSAMLphp DiscoJuice module.

Operating a central DiscoJuice instance, involves maintaining a ACL of return addresses that are allowed to retreive user's preferred provider. If you are using the SimpleSAMLphp DiscoJuice module, this ACL [is configured in discojuicecentral.php](simplesamlphp-module-config).
