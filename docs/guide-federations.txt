DiscoJuice Guide for Federations
================================


Some topics that affects you as a federation operator:

* Generation of DiscoJuiceJSON at discojuice.org
* Offering DiscoJuice friendly metadata
* Offering a central discovery service


## Generation of DiscoJuiceJSON at discojuice.org

If you operate an Identity Federation, you may contact <andreas.solberg@uninett.no> about offering an automatically generated feed at `discojuice.org`.

Here is a list of feeds already available:

* <https://static.discojuice.org/feeds/>



## Offering DiscoJuice friendly metadata


If you already have your federation metadata generated here: <https://static.discojuice.org/feeds/> – what can you do to improve the data quality, and then also the DiscoJuice user experience?


You probably already offer SAML 2.0 Metadata to your Federation members. This metadata probably contains technical details about the SAML entities and in addition a *Organization name*.

There is a lot more information that you can (and should) include in your metadata.

The most important reference here is the metadata extension for UI:

* [Metadata Extensions for Login and Discovery User Interface](http://wiki.oasis-open.org/security/SAML2MetadataUI)

The following information will be used by DiscoJuice:

* DisplayName
* Description
* Keywords
* Logo
* GeolocationHint

The following information is not supported yet, but will be soon:

* IPHint
* DomainHint


The following information will not be used:

* InformationURL
* PrivacyStatementURL


DiscoJuice does not support SAML 2.0 Metadata, but instead interprets it's own more compact format, [DiscoJuiceJSON](discojuicejson). `discojuice.org` performs automated generated of DiscoJuiceJSON from SAML 2.0 Metadata.



## Offering a central discovery service

If the Federation already has a decent DiscoJuiceJSON feed in place (see above), the next step may be to setup a central Discovery Service (or Storage) using DiscoJuice. It is off course not neccessary to operate a central Discovery Service in a Federation, but many Federations already does this, and would like to contiue doing so.

To setup a standalone central discovery service using DiscoJuice:
