# Installing DiscoJuice hosted locally


Currently DiscoJuice is focused towards being hosted on `discojuice.org`. That said, you can easily setup DiscoJuice on your own.

Setting up DiscoJuice from scratch is currently not yet documented, because the flexibility allows so many different ways to deploy it. 

You should start by grabbing the source here:
