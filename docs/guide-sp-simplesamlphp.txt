Guide for SimpleSAMLphp as Service Provider
=======================


If you are using SimpleSAMLphp as a Service Provider, and would like to use DiscoJuice for IdP Discovery, it should be prettu straight forward.

Follow the documentation:

* [Installing DiscoJuice as part of SimpleSAMLphp](simplesamlphp-module)
* [Configure the SimpleSAMLphp DiscoJuice Module](simplesamlphp-module-config)
* [Reference to DiscoJuice Configuration](configuration-reference)

The quality of the DiscoJuice deployment will depend on the quality of the metadata you feed it with. If your federation does not offer DiscoJuice-friendly metadata, you may choose to override the metadata of some of the entries using the `'overrides'` option in `discojuicefeed.php`.
