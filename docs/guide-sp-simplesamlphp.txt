Guide for SimpleSAMLphp as Service Provider
=======================


If you are using SimpleSAMLphp as a Service Provider, and would like to use DiscoJuice for IdP Discovery, follow this guide.



## Installing SimpleSAMLphp

Currently the discojuice module is [available only in SimpleSAMLphp trunk](http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/1.7/simplesamlphp-subversion). Make sure you run the latest version of [SimpleSAMLphp](http://simplesamlphp.org/).


## Enabling DiscoJuice Module


Enable the discojuice module, and the required dependency modules `sanitycheck`, `cron`:

	touch modules/discojuice/enable

Copy the configuration templates:

	cp modules/discojuice/config-templates/*.php config/


## Configure the module

You'll be able to configure the module, using the `config/discojuice.php` configuration file:

	$config = array(
	
		// A human readable name describing the Service Provider
		'name' => 'Service',
	
		/* A set of prepared metadata feeds from discojuice.org
		 * You may visit
		 * 		https://static.discojuice.org/feeds/
		 *
		 * to review the available feed identifiers.
		 * You may choose to not use any of the provider feed, by setting this to an 
		 * empty array: array()
		 */
		'feeds' => array('edugain'),
	
		/*
		 * You may provide additional feeds
		 */
		'additionalFeeds' => array(
		),
	
		/*
		 * If you set this value to true, the module will contact discojuice.org to read and write cookies.
		 * If you enable this, you will also need to get your host accepted in the access control list of 
		 * discojuice.org
		 *
		 * The response url of your service, similar to:
		 *
		 *		https://sp.example.org/simplesaml/module.php/discojuice/response.html	
		 *
		 * will need to be registered at discojuice.org. If your response url is already registered in the metadata
		 * of one of the federation feeds at discojuice.org, you should already have access.
		 */
		'enableCentralStorage' => false,
	
	);

If you would like to offer additional feeds, please check the specification of the DiscoJuiceJSON format:
